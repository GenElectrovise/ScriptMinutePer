# ScriptMinutePer
ScriptMinutePer is a programming language (for which this is primarily the interpreter), with the best wishes of the guys at Clicks Minute Per. (Thanks for your name!). 

Anyone wants to complain? Go ask Minion3665 and he'll tell you he let me do this.

The interpreter is written in C. (Well actually C++ at the time of writing, but it's literally two .cpps and a header and I intend to change that)
